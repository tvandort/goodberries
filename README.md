Allow input in one section.
Allow adding multiple strategies.
Allow drag and drop player order or an option to sort by a given factor.
Let the algorithm always lowball player or add a configuration for a given strategy to add the goodberry that would overheal a player with the least waste.

TODO:
Make algorithm faster by not brute forcing it.
I should be able to take a BerryCount input, then use modulo to figure out how many berries per level.
This will likely remove Berry[] as a data structure and replace it with only BerryCounts.
